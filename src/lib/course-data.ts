      modelAnswer:
        "A customer searches for a product on Amazon by typing or using voice. Amazon returns a results page with a mix of sponsored ads and organic listings. The customer clicks a product, views the detail page, and if the offer is good (price, reviews, Prime, Buy Box) adds to cart and purchases. After receiving the product, they may leave a review that influences future shoppers.",

      question: "When can a high ACoS be acceptable (for example, during which phase of a product's life)?",
      modelAnswer:
        "A high ACoS (e.g. 30–50%) can be acceptable during the launch phase (first ~30 days) when the goal is data collection, ranking, and keyword discovery rather than immediate profit.",
    },
    {
      id: "p1q5",
      type: "open",
      question: "What is the difference between ACoS and TACoS, and why is TACoS important?",
      modelAnswer:
        "ACoS = Ad Spend ÷ Ad Sales — measures efficiency of ad spend against ad-attributed sales only. TACoS = Ad Spend ÷ Total Revenue (ad + organic) — measures the impact of ads on the entire business. TACoS is important because successful ads grow organic ranking and organic sales, which dilutes ad spend as a share of total revenue. A rising ACoS with a falling TACoS often signals healthy scaling.",
